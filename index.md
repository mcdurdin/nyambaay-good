# ញ៉ាំបាយ.com

This site is:

- ញ៉ាំបាយ.com
- xn--r2ewp8ib8gta.com
- U+1789 U+17C9 U+17B6 U+17C6  U+1794 U+17B6 U+1799

That's the correct encoding.

The sister site [ញុំាបាយ.com](https://ញុំាបាយ.com/) is

- ញុំាបាយ.com
- xn--r2ewp8ib1a1f.com
- U+1789 U+17BB U+17C6  U+1794 U+17B6 U+1799

That's [wrongly encoded](https://marc.durdin.net/2017/03/when-phishers-eat-rice/).

# ញុំាបាយ.com vs ញ៉ាំបាយ.com

Why is this a problem? If you are viewing this site on a Mac or iOS device, you'll see a dotted circle in the middle of the name of this site. However, on current Windows and Android devices (by far the majority in Cambodia), there will either not be any difference between these names, or the difference will be so subtle that you almost certainly won't notice it. You can see that both sites have certificates. What if one was a bank?

This was an experiment to see (a) how viable Khmer domain names were, and (b) how much of a problem these rendering issues are.
